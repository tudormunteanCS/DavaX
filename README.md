# üöÄ Endava Training Projects ‚Äì Data Engineer/Software Developer üß†

üëã Welcome to my **training portfolio** as a **Data Engineer/Developer** at **Endava**!  
This repository contains all the bite-sized, hands-on projects I've built during my **3-month training journey** üõ†Ô∏è

## üìÅ One Repo to Rule Them All üóÉÔ∏è

Because each project is small but powerful üí•, I've kept everything neatly organized in a **single repository**.

## üìÖ Timeline Highlights
 
### Month1 - üß± Generic RDBMS & PLSQL & ETL
- ‚úÖ Worked with SQL (Microsoft SQL Server & Oracle)gi
- ‚úÖ Created a logging framework
- ‚úÖ Created a Timesheet database where each employee's time worked can be tracked
- ‚úÖ Took some Prompt Engineering trainings


### Month2 - üêç Python & Data Science & AI Fundamentals & Pydantic
- ‚úÖ Worked on an ETL project where integrated 3 sources of data (Confluence leaves, Timesheets, Meeting Attendances) using Python scripts and Pandas üêº
- ‚úÖ Python from Basic Algorithms -> Advanced topics such as concurrency, async functions, event loops, Global Interpretor Lock (GIL), Garbage Collector,
- ‚úÖ Python Authentication using HTTPBasicAuth / HTTPDigestAuth / Bearer Auth using JWT tokens
- ‚úÖ Python pydantic Basemodels
- ‚úÖ Flask + React app that exposes 3 APIs for computing(power to the 2, n-th Fibonacci, factorial). For persistance used SQLModel (pydantic) that could easily validate and store in SQL lite.


### Month 3 LLM Integration & OpenAI API & DevOps
- ‚úÖ Agentüïµ for currency convertor that could answer prompts like this: "How many Euros were 2400 RONS in 2022-11-28?". Used OpenAI function calling, pydantic and integrated
    ExchangeRata.host API for historical conversion rates
- ‚úÖ # RAG workflow for book recommendations based on user preferences (mostly topic).

## Hosting the Qdrant Client locally: Docker
## Vector store + Semantic Search: Qdrant
## LLM Tool calling + generation + Embeddings: OpenAI
## Frontend: React + Typescript
## Backend: Python + Flask
## Toxic Language Detection: Guardrails
Workflow: User asks the chatbot to recommend books based on a topic or genre. The chatbot uses the RAG workflow to retrieve relevant book information from Qdrant vector store and generates a response using gpt-5
- üê≥ Docker for containerization a Flask + React app that also uses a SqlLite. Managed Dockerfiles, used gunicorn for runing flask app, nginx for runing the react app
- üê≥ Docker Compose for orchestrating multi-container setup.
- üê≥ Deploy Qdrant on Kubernetes with a NodePort service for hosting the DB locally
